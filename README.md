Project Title: Billing system with card validity checking(console based)
Hey, I'm Aisha Siddqiua and this is my very first C++ project. It’s a management system with a card payment and validation system. It is will perform 3 tasks in total. It will ask for a payment method. In case of card, it will only show the message of payment processed only after the card is proved valid by the program which will be using Luhn’s algorithm for card validation. It would need a password to be accessed. It would also be able to show previous entries by the user. 
Operations/Tasks:
1.	Functions 
2.	If else 
3.	Luhn’s algorithm 
4.	Files 
5.	Loops
6.	Switch
7.Object oriented programming such as classes
